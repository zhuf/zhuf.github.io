You can call me Carlos Agarie (pronounced 'ah-ga-rii-eh'). In some online communities, I go by the name Onox. I'm a control/software engineering student.

This blog is a by-product of boring college classes and my readings of [The Non-Designer's Design Book](http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Edition-Designers-ebook/dp/B00125MJYM/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1344048960&sr=8-1). It's made using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).

Everything (except my posts and, possibly, images) is open source and can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/agarie/so-zetta-slow).

Until august/2013, I'm living in Prescott, AZ. I'm an exchange student at [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embry%E2%80%93Riddle_Aeronautical_University) thanks to Brazil's [Science Without Borders](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng/) program.

I also play pok√©mon.
