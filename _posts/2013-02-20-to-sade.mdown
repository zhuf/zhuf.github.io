Pleasure is your only law.<br />
Nature is your queen.<br />
Blind and deaf,<br />
You, exulting, cling<br />
To the worms inside your skin.<br />
"Come flock to me," you cry aloud,<br />
"Come taste what wisdom brings!<br />
"For none sets free from life's deceit<br />
"But the truth only I have seen!"<br />
