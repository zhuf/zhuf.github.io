I'm delivering this site through [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and its spectacular [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) static site generator. I had never heard of Jekyll until yesterday, but I'm already impressed with its power and simplicity---mostly the simplicity. 

I might be getting ahead of myself here, but I dare say I've found my blogging home.

```
print 'Hello, World!'
```
